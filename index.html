                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a lonely girl who found herself waiting at a train station, uncertain of what lay ahead. She had spent many nights feeling like a passenger in her own life, watching the world move around her while she remained stuck in place.</p>
                    
                    <p>She clutched her bag tightly, staring at the tracks. She had been told to wait here, but deep down, she knew no one was coming.</p>

                    <p>Deep within an enchanted land, there existed a magical wardrobe kept by a man named Rick. This wasn't just any closet—it was filled with gifts originally meant for someone else, only to be repurposed at the last minute.</p>
                    
                    <p>A children's book meant for ages 4-8? A Halloween robe from a failed romance? Rick's collection of second-hand gifts grew with each relationship.</p>

                    <p>Some had been carefully chosen. Others... repurposed.</p>

                    <p>She sipped the drink, the strange combination of flavors lingering on her tongue, and wondered: Was this a gift? Or just something given?</p>

                    <p>The robe carried history, but she wasn't sure she wanted to be part of its lineage.</p>
                    
                    <p>One day, a beautiful princess from Canada appeared, dazzling the kingdom with her charm. Unlike the girl, the Canadian princess was untouched by Rick's peculiar gift-giving habits.</p>

                    <p>The girl noticed how differently Rick behaved around the princess. Suddenly, his gifts to the princess were thoughtful, original, carefully chosen.</p>
                    
                    <p>And in that moment, the gifts that once held meaning for the girl felt different.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, there was a lonely girl who found herself waiting at a train station, uncertain of what lay ahead. She had spent many nights feeling like a passenger in her own life, watching the world move around her while she remained stuck in place.</p>
            
            <p>She clutched her bag tightly, staring at the tracks. She had been told to wait here, but deep down, she knew no one was coming.</p>

        <div class="page">
            <p>Deep within an enchanted land, there existed a magical wardrobe kept by a man named Rick. This wasn't just any closet—it was filled with gifts originally meant for someone else, only to be repurposed at the last minute.</p>
            
            <p>A children's book meant for ages 4-8? A Halloween robe from a failed romance? Rick's collection of second-hand gifts grew with each relationship.</p>

            <p>There were shimmering jewels, mysterious packages wrapped in golden paper, and trinkets that whispered secrets of their past owners. But not all gifts in the wardrobe were truly meant for the ones who received them.</p>
            
            <p>Some had been carefully chosen. Others... repurposed.</p>

            <p>One day, a mysterious box arrived for the girl.</p>
            
            <p>"Surely, this will be a meaningful gift," she thought.</p>
            
            <p>But when she opened it, inside was not a grand romantic gesture, but a half-hearted attempt wrapped in Amazon packaging, hastily selected from Rick's collection.</p>

            <p>Rick, the keeper of the wardrobe, watched over his collection with a strange sort of pride. He smiled and offered her a drink.</p>
            
            <p>The options? A glass of vodka or a glass of carrot juice. No mixers, no compromise.</p>
            
            <p>She stared at the choices, wondering if this was a metaphor for their entire relationship.</p>

            <p>Rick believed in the magic of gifts, but he had forgotten how to give from the heart. He was a man of habits, of patterns, of rituals that seemed meaningful on the surface but often left something hollow beneath them.</p>
            
            <p>She sipped the drink, the strange combination of flavors lingering on her tongue, and wondered: Was this a gift? Or just something given?</p>

            <p>Among Rick's treasures was a mysterious Halloween robe, one that seemed to pass from hand to hand, whispering secrets of its former owners.</p>
            
            <p>"Take it," he said, placing it over her shoulders as if it had always belonged to her.</p>
            
            <p>Had it, though? Or had it once wrapped around someone else, gifted in another moment of fleeting affection?</p>

            <p>The robe carried history, but she wasn't sure she wanted to be part of its lineage.</p>
            
            <p>One day, a beautiful princess from Canada appeared, dazzling the kingdom with her charm. Unlike the girl, the Canadian princess was untouched by Rick's peculiar gift-giving habits.</p>

            <p>The girl noticed how differently Rick behaved around the princess. Suddenly, his gifts to the princess were thoughtful, original, carefully chosen.</p>
            
            <p>And in that moment, the gifts that once held meaning for the girl felt different.</p>
